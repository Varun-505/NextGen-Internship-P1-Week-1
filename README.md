Real-Time Collaboration App (Frontend)
This repository contains the frontend of the Real-Time Collaboration App, built with React and Vite. 
The app is designed to allow real-time collaboration for users with seamless UI and fast interactions.

Tech Stack (Frontend)
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: A modern build tool that provides fast development and optimized production builds.

Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework used for building responsive layouts.

Vite React Plugin: Handles fast refresh and optimizations for React apps.

ESLint: For code linting and ensuring code quality.

Getting Started
To get started with the frontend of this project, follow the steps below.

1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone 
cd real-time-collaboration-app

2. Install dependencies
After cloning the repository, you need to install the required dependencies for the frontend.
In the client folder, run the following command: 
npm install
This will install the necessary packages and dependencies defined in package.json.

3. Run the development server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the Vite development server by running:
npm run dev
This command will start the React app in development mode and open it in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) will ensure that changes you make to the code are instantly reflected in the browser without requiring a full page reload.

Project Structure (Frontend)
The frontend structure is organized as follows:

├── src/                       # Source code for the frontend
│   ├── assets/                 # Static assets used in the app (e.g., images)
│   ├── components/             # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── Navbar.jsx          # Navigation bar component
│   │   ├── Footer.jsx          # Footer component
│   │   └── LoginForm.jsx       # Login form component
│   ├── pages/                  # Pages for different routes (Home, Dashboard, Login)
│   │   ├── Home.jsx            # Home page
│   │   ├── Dashboard.jsx       # Dashboard page
│   │   └── Login.jsx           # Login page
│   ├── App.jsx                 # Main App component (routes, layout)
│   ├── index.jsx               # Entry point for React app
│   └── style.css               # Global styles and custom CSS
│
├── vite.config.js              # Vite configuration file
├── package.json                # Dependencies and scripts for the frontend
└── README.md                   # Project documentation (this file)

Vite + React Setup
This project uses Vite as the build tool for its fast development server and optimized production builds.

React Fast Refresh
Vite comes with built-in support for React and enables Fast Refresh out of the box. 
Fast Refresh ensures that React components preserve their state while the code is hot-reloaded during development.

Vite uses the @vitejs/plugin-react for this functionality. 
If you wish to use SWC (Rust-based fast compiler) instead of Babel for React, you can follow these steps:

1. Install SWC Plugin (optional)
If you prefer using SWC for faster builds:
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react-swc --save-dev
2. Update Vite Config (optional)
In your vite.config.js, replace the Babel plugin with the SWC plugin:

javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'  // SWC plugin for React Fast Refresh

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
})

3. Restart the development server
After making changes, restart the development server:
npm run dev

Frontend Features

1. Landing Page
The landing page contains a welcoming message and call-to-action buttons (such as "Login" and "Register").

2. Login & Registration Forms
Simple forms to allow users to log in and register. These forms collect the user's email and password for authentication.

3. Responsive Layout
The UI uses Bootstrap to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The layout is mobile-friendly, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.

4. Reusable Components
The project uses React components to maintain a modular structure:

Navbar: A fixed navigation bar for easy navigation between pages.
Footer: A fixed footer that stays at the bottom of the page.
Forms: Reusable form components for login, registration, etc.
Next Steps for the Frontend
Real-time Collaboration: The next step is to implement real-time collaboration features (e.g., live chat, notifications) using WebSockets or Socket.io.
User Dashboard: Add user-specific data to the dashboard after successful login.
Troubleshooting
Error: module not found: If you encounter any missing modules, ensure that all dependencies are installed by running npm install in the client directory.

Vite HMR issues: If hot module replacement is not working properly, restart the development server with npm run dev.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
